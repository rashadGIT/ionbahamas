# react-calendar-events
React calendar for displaying events

### Credits
This repository is basically [React Big Calendar](https://github.com/intljusticemission/react-big-calendar). The differences are that 
this repository uses `sass` instead of you have to import the `css` file, some layout changes and it uses only the `moment` so you don't 
have to set the wich lib you will use.
