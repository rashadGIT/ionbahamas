been the Partners First Program Manager on a number of projects for The Crowther Group. The most exciting part of my job is coordinating our safety and affirmative action programs. I have had the pleasure of developing, implementing and enforcing policies that impact people’s lives. I work directly with the jobsite personnel to ensure they have proper training and follow accident prevention policies. People are our most important asset, and I am charged to keep them safe and free from harassment and discrimination.</p>\r\n  <p>What is your philosophy about giving back to the community?</p>\r\n  <p>I grew up in a family of eight girls and worked my way through college as a busboy in restaurants. I understand how important it is to be given an opportunity to learn and succeed so I’m proud of our company’s commitment to giving back to the community – especially in areas that are underserved or lagging in clean, up-to-date facilities. When I see a facility or retail establishment we have renovated, I am proud that people in our community have a new space to enjoy.</p>\r\n  <p>Name a technology innovation that has made an impact in construction or an area where there are opportunities for innovation.</p>\r\n  <p>As the Partners First Program Manager, I realize innovation and new technologies are all around us.   We have training webinars not meetings, we have can access every project file on our smartphones, and tablets to mark-up site plans.  When I worked for Coca Cola and Club Corp in my early career there were file cabinets and fax machines.  We had a calendar on the wall and a notebook full of addresses—now it’s literally all in the palm of my hand.  Our Procore project management software even takes all the information gathered about a given project and translates into reports for our clients.  The time that saves us and our clients is amazing!</p>\r\n  <p>Tell us an awesome fact about yourself or the role you have in the company.</p>\r\n  <p>I grew up in the Bahamas and understand the importance of diversity. My family taught me to inspire people quietly and remember that listening is often more important than offering advice. I have had the opportunity to impress that philosophy upon members of my Crowther Group family, especially as I meet with on-site crew members to make sure all construction workers are following established safety regulations. The other key thing I learned growing up was, the worst thing that happen is you can fail, but you can’t fail or succeed if you don’t try.</p></div>);\r\n\r\nclass member extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props){\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state={\r\n      loading : true,\r\n      err : false\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillMount(){\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount(){\r\n\r\n  }\r\n  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo){\r\n    this.setState({err : true})\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  \r\n  render() {\r\n    const hi = \"This text is the content of the box.
